		   <b>Lentiviruses</b>
		   (<a target="_blank" href ="https://viralzone.expasy.org/264">genus <i>Lentivirus</i></a>)
		   are complex retroviruses
		   (<a target="_blank" href ="https://viralzone.expasy.org/71">family <i>Retroviridae</i></a>)
		   that cause chronic, persistent infections in mammals, including humans. 
           They are best known as the genus of retroviruses that includes 
		   <b>human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)</b>. 

		 </p>

		 <p>
		   Virus genome sequence data are extremely information-rich, especially when combined with other
		   forms of data. The 
		   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools"><b>GLUE software framework</b></a>
		   provides an extensible platform for implementing 'sequence-based resources' that 
		   represent the semantic links between sequences and other data items via a
		   relational database.
		   This minimises the requirement for labour-intensive pre-processing of data, and 
		   allows sequence-based analyses to be implemented in an efficient, standardised
		   and reproducible way.
		 </p>

		 <p>
		   This is <b>Lentivirus-GLUE</b>, a

		   <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>GLUE</b></a>
		   project developed to support comparative genomic and evolutionary analysis of
		   <a target="_blank" href="https://viralzone.expasy.org/9">lentiviruses</a>
		   (family <i>Lentivirus</i>).

	   </h3>
       <hr>


		 <p>
		   <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>GLUE</b></a> is an open, integrated
		   software toolkit that provides functionality for storage and interpretation of
		   sequence data. It supports the development of bespoke “projects” containing the data items
		   required for comparative genomic analysis
		   (e.g.  sequences, multiple sequence alignments, genome feature annotations,
		   and other sequence-associated data). 
		 </p>


        
         <p><img src="./website/assets/images/lentivirus-glue-project.jpg" alt="Lentivirus GLUE project figure"/></p>
         


		 <p>
		   Projects are loaded into the <b>GLUE "engine"</b>, creating a relational database
		   that represents the semantic relationships between data items.
		   This provides a robust foundation for the implementation of <b>systematic
		   comparative analyses</b> and the development of <b>sequence-based resources</b>. 
		 </p>

        
         <p><img src="./website/assets/images/lentivirus-glue-usage.jpg" alt="Using Lentivirus GLUE"/></p>
           


		 <p>
		   GLUE projects are equally suited for carrying out exploratory work 
		   (e.g. using virus genome data to investigate structural and functional properties of viruses)
		   as they are for implementing operational procedures (e.g. producing
		   <a target="_blank" href="http://hcv-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/exampleReports/resistanceGeno1.html?hcvGlueVersion=0.1.68""><b>standardised reports</b></a>
		   in a public or animal health setting).
		 </p>
		   


		 <p>
			Hosting of GLUE projects in an online version control system (e.g. <b>GitHub</b>) provides
			a mechanism for their stable, collaborative development, as shown below.

	   <a id="WhyGlueProject" class="anchor" href="#glueProject" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>What does building the Lentivirus-GLUE project offer?</strong>
	   </h3>
	   <hr>

		 
 
		 <p>
		 
			Lentivirus-GLUE offers a number of advantages for performing comparative sequence
			analysis of lentiviruses:

		   <ol>

			 <li> <strong>Reproducibility</strong>. 
			 For many reasons, bioinformatics analyses are notoriously difficult to reproduce.
			 The GLUE framework supports the implementation of fully reproducible 
			 comparative genomics through the introduction of data standards and the use 
			 of a relational database to capture the semantic links between data items.
			 </li>
			 <br>
		   
			 <li> <strong>Reusable data objects and analysis logic</strong>. 
			 For many - if not most - comparative genomic analyses, data preparation is nine
			 tenths of the battle. The GLUE framework has been designed to ensure that 
			 work spent preparing high-value data items such as multiple sequence alignments
			 need only be performed once. Hosting of GLUE projects in an online version control 
			 system such as GitHub allows for collaborative management of important data items
			 and community testing of hypotheses.
			 </li>
			 <br>


			 <li> <strong>Validation</strong>. 
			 Building GLUE projects entails mapping the semantic links between data items
			 (e.g. sequences, tabular data, multiple sequence alignments).
			 This process provides an opportunity 
			 for cross-validation, and thereby enforces a high level of data integrity.
			 </li>
			 <br>
		 
			 <li> <strong>Standardisation of the genomic co-ordinate space</strong>. GLUE
			 projects allow all sequences to utilise the coordinate space of a chosen 
			 reference sequence. Contingencies associated with insertions and deletions
			 (indels) are handled in a systematic way.
			 </li>
			 <br>
		   
			 <li> <strong>Predefined, fully annotated reference sequences</strong>:
			 This project includes fully-annotated reference sequences for major lineages
			 within the <i>Lentivirus</i> family.
			 </li>
			 <br>
		   
			 <li> <strong>Alignment trees</strong>:
			 GLUE allows linking of alignments constructed at distinct taxonomic levels
			 via an  "<b>alignment tree</b>"
			 data structure. In the alignment tree, each alignment
			 is constrained to a standard reference sequence, thus all multiple sequence
			 alignments are linked to one another via a standardised coordinate system.
			 </li>
			 
		   </ol>

		 </p>


         <br>

	   
		 <p>
		
		   Some examples of the ways in which this GLUE resource can be used include:
		   
		   <ol>
		 
			 <li> To perform comparative genomic studies across the family <i>Lentivirus</i>,
			 e.g. as part of an investigation of lentivirus diversity.
			 </li>
			 <br>
		   
		   
			 <li> To facilitate in-depth comparative investigations of any virus species or group
			 within the family <i>Lentivirus</i>.
			 </li>
			 <br>
		   
			 <li> As a source of systematically organised information about
			 <a href="./website/html/paleoviruses.html"><b>endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) derived from lentiviruses</b></a>.
			 </li>
		   
		   </ol>

	   </h3>
       <hr>


		   
		 <p>
	
		   On computers with <a href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/installation">GLUE installed</a>,
		   the <b>Lentivirus-GLUE</b> project can be instantiated by navigating to the project folder,
		   initiating GLUE, and issuing the following command in the GLUE shell:
         
  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /
  GLUE> run file buildLentivirusCoreProject.glue</code></pre>
		 
		 </p>

        This will build the Lentivirus-GLUE core project by executing the commands in
		 <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE/blob/master/buildLentivirusCoreProject.glue"><b>this file</b></a>.
		 
	   </p>


	   <p>
		 The <i>Lentivirus</i> project can be further extended to incorporate
		 ERV sequences by executing the commands in
		 <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE/blob/master/buildLentivirusPaleoProject.glue"><b>this file</b></a>,
		 as follows.
         
  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /
  GLUE> run file buildLentivirusPaleoProject.glue</code></pre>
		 		  
	   </p>
