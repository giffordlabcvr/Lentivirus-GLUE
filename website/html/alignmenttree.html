		<p>
          GLUE projects have the option of using a data structure called an <b>alignment tree</b>
          to link constrained multiple sequence alignments representing different
          taxonomic levels, and we've used this approach in Lentivirus-GLUE.

		<p>
		  The schematic figure above shows the alignment tree structure in <b>Lentivirus-GLUE</b>.
		  We have constructed 'tip' alignments at genus level, as well as a genus-level root
		  alignment. 
		</p>
         
</blockquote>


 	    <br>
		<p>       
          For the lower
          taxonomic levels (i.e. within and below genus level) we aligned complete coding
          sequences.
          For the highest taxonomic levels (i.e. at the root) we aligned only the most
          conserved gene (the viral polymerase). 
          We used an alignment tree data structure to link these  alignments,
          via a set of common reference sequences.
          The root alignment contains all reference sequences, whereas all children of the
          root inherit at least one reference from their immediate parent.
          Thus, all alignments are linked to one another via our chosen set of
          master reference sequences.
