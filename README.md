Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Lentivirus-GLUE**!

Lentiviruses (family *Retroviridae*, genus *Lentivirus*) are complex retroviruses that cause chronic, persistent infections in mammals, including humans. They are best known as the genus of retroviruses that includes **human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)**.

Lentivirus-GLUE is a sequence-oriented resource for comparative genomic analysis of lentiviruses (family *Retroviridae*, genus *Lentivirus*), developed using the **[GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools)** software framework. 

GLUE is an open, integrated software toolkit that provides functionality for storage and interpretation of sequence data. It provides an extensible platform for implementing 'sequence-based resources' that represent the semantic links between sequences and other data items via a relational database. This minimises the requirement for labour-intensive pre-processing of data, and allows sequence-based analyses to be implemented in an efficient, standardised and reproducible way.

Please see the **[User Guide](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE/wiki)** for more details.

## Extension layers 

This **Lentivirus-GLUE**  project can be extended with additional layers, openly available via GitHub, including:

  - **[Lentivirus-GLUE-Primates](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE-Primates)**: all NCBI sequence data for primate lentiviruses, including HIV-1 and HIV-2.
  - **[Lentivirus-GLUE-SRLV](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE-SRLV)**: small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs), all NCBI sequence data plus curated metatdata and analysis logic.
  - **[Lentivirus-GLUE-EIAV](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE-EIAV)**: equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), all NCBI sequence data.
  - **[Lentivirus-GLUE-FIV](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE-FIV)**: feline immunodeficiency viruses (FIVs), all NCBI sequence data.
  - **[Lentivirus-GLUE-ERV](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE-ERV)**: adds lentivirus sequences that occur as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs).

## Key Features

- **GLUE Framework Integration**: Built on the GLUE software framework, Lentivirus-GLUE offers an extensible platform for efficient, standardized, and reproducible computational genomic analysis of Lentivirus virus.

- **Phylogenetic Structure**: Sequence data in Lentivirus-GLUE is organized in a phylogenetically-structured manner, allowing users to explore evolutionary relationships easily.

- **Rich Annotations**: Annotated reference sequences enable rigorous comparative genomic analysis related to conservation, adaptation, structural context, and genotype-to-phenotype associations.

- **Exploratory and operational**: The GLUE framework allows sequence-based resources to be used for exploratory work in a research setting, as well as operational work in a public or animal health setting.

## Installation

Please see the **[User Guide](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE/wiki/Installation)**.

## Usage

GLUE contains an interactive command line environment focused on the development and use of GLUE projects by bioinformaticians. This provides a range of productivity-oriented features such as automatic command completion, command history and interactive paging through tabular data. 

For detailed instructions on how to use Lentivirus-GLUE for your comparative genomic analysis, refer to the GLUE's [reference documentation](http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/).

## Data Sources

Lentivirus-GLUE is constructed using sequence data obtained from [NCBI Nucleotide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore).
