## Installation of GLUE projects

You can install the GLUE projects collated within the DIGS-for-EVEs repository
on computers running Windows, MacOSX or Linux. 

1. Install GLUE, based on the [GLUE installation instructions](http://tools.glue.cvr.ac.uk/#/installation). 
2. Once GLUE is installed and working, you should clone the DIGS-for-EVEs repository into your `gluetools/projects` directory.
3. Within the `gluetools/projects/DIGS-for-EVEs` directory, start GLUE and build individual project by issuing the following command in GLUE:
```
Mode path: /
GLUE> run file [path to project build file name]
```

This should run to completion and produce the `OK` result.
