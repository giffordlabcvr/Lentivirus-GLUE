# Lentivirus-GLUE: Phylogenomic Analysis of Lentiviruses

<img src="md/Lentivirus-glue-logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="280" />

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Lentivirus-GLUE**!

Lentivirus-GLUE is a sequence-oriented resource for comparative genomic analysis of lentiviruses (family *Retroviridae*, genus *Lentivirus*), developed using the **[GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools)** software framework.

## Key Features

- **GLUE Framework Integration**: Built on the GLUE software framework, Lentivirus-GLUE offers an extensible platform for efficient, standardized, and reproducible computational genomic analysis of Lentivirus virus.

- **Phylogenetic Structure**: Sequence data in Lentivirus-GLUE is organized in a phylogenetically-structured manner, allowing users to explore evolutionary relationships easily.

- **Rich Annotations**: Annotated reference sequences enable rigorous comparative genomic analysis related to conservation, adaptation, structural context, and genotype-to-phenotype associations.

- **Exploratory and operational**: The GLUE framework allows sequence-based resources to be used for exploratory work in a research setting, as well as operational work in a public or animal health setting.


## Installation

If you have not done so already, install the GLUE software framework by following the [installation instructions](http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/installation) on the GLUE web site: 

Download the Lentivirus-GLUE repository, navigate into the top-level directory, and start the GLUE command line interpreter.

At the GLUE command prompt, run the 'buildLentivirusProject.glue' file as follows:

```

Mode path: /
GLUE> run file buildCoreProject.glue
```

This will build the base or 'core' project, which contains a minimal set of feature definitions, clade categories, reference sequences, and alignments.

## Usage

GLUE contains an interactive command line environment focused on the development and use of GLUE projects by bioinformaticians. This provides a range of productivity-oriented features such as automatic command completion, command history and interactive paging through tabular data. 

For detailed instructions on how to use Lentivirus-GLUE for your comparative genomic analysis, refer to the GLUE's [reference documentation](http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/).
